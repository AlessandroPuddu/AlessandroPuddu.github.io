            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a dedicated Unity Developer with a breadth of skills spanning gameplay engineering, AI development, shader programming, and more. With a rich background in Computer Science from the University of Milan, I have used my skills to contribute to a variety of immersive games, including the RPG 'Alaloth: Champions of The Four Kingdoms' and 'Apocalypse Rangers', a post-apocalyptic online twin-stick shooter.
            </p>
            <p>
                My technical prowess extends beyond gameplay, with demonstrated proficiency in AR/VR application development, networking, and an array of development tools like Unity, C#, Git, Asana, Jira, Visual Studio, and JetBrains Rider. A committed learner, I am also actively enhancing my skills in C++ and Unreal Engine. Beyond my technical abilities, I bring a keen understanding of SOLID principles, design patterns, Agile development methodology, and a strong team spirit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When not developing games, I can be found exploring various game genres as an avid gamer, and playing guitar and bass guitar as an amateur musician, expressing my creativity beyond the digital realm.
